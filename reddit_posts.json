        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI often see questions around here about how to come up with startup ideas or SAAS concepts. I think it's one that a lot of people struggle with so just wanted to see if anyone is doing anything out of the ordinary to get their creative juices flowing. Usually my startup ideas come when I least expect it, as in when I'm not actually trying to think of an idea but I've found a few ways that help me at least get the balls in motion for coming up with ideas and they generally plant seeds for me to come up with ideas at a later stage. This worked for my [startup idea](https://www.findmicrosaasideas.com/micro-saas-ideas-collection) so hopefully it can help some people out.\n\n**Trustpilot**\n\n1. Go to Trustpilot\n2. Select the business category that your interested in\n3. Check out the top companies\n4. Filter by 2 & 3 star reviews (1 star reviews aren't the best for this because it's just people hating on the product)\n5. See if you could solve any of the frustrations of the customers and you might just stumble upon a new startup idea\n\n[**Acquire.com**](http://acquire.com)\n\n1. Go to  (you'll need to sign up)\n2. Filter companies that are doing over 100K a year (you can change this number but filtering over this number can get you some really good ideas)\n3. Look for product ideas that resonates with you\n4. Are there any features that are missing from the product? If so you could be onto something.\n\n**Ahref keyword generator**\n\n1. Go to [https://ahrefs.com/keyword-generator](https://ahrefs.com/keyword-generator)\n2. Search for random stuff to find keywords with a high volume (number of people searching) with a low KD (Keyword difficulty - how difficult it would be to rank in the top 10 on google. 20 and below would be what we're looking for here)\n3. Based on what you find do a search on Google and see if there is any tool on top of Google.\n4. If not then you've found an idea that might be worth going with. If there already is a tool maybe you could build a better one?\n\nThese are my go tos on how to get the creative juices flowing and they tend to help me when I'm drawing blanks on coming up with ideas.\n\nThen when I have an idea for a product I ask myself the following questions to make sure it's something I want to pursue:\n\n>Would I use the product\n\n>Can I find the audience for this product?\n\n>Can I win their attention?\n\n>Can I build it in 1 month max?",
